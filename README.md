# Java Games
## Project Evolution
This project will evolve, creating multiple games that build off of each other. I am taking this approach to achieve three things:
1. At least one working game that I can use in the future
2. Decent modularity that will keep everything simpler and more organized
3. To hopefully stay interested in this project longer
