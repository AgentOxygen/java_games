# Java Games
## Project Evolution
This project will evolve, creating multiple games that build off of each other. I am taking this approach to achieve three things:
1. At least one working game that I can use in the future
2. Decent modularity that will keep everything simpler and more organized
3. To hopefully stay interested in this project longer

## Planned Progresison
1.	Tick-tack-toe
    *	Local coop
2.	Snake
3.  Tick-tack-toe 2.0
    *	Multiplayer
    *	AI
4.	Physics Box
    *	Gravity
    *	Collisions
    *	Player movement
5.	Speed runners copy
6.	The gameâ€¦

## Dependencies
All assets and external dependencies will be accounted for here for posterity.

This project will use libGDX as the game engine. https://libgdx.com/
